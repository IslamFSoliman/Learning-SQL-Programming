We need to know the average events happening per day for each channel
SELECT channel,
       AVG(event_count) AS avg_event_count
  FROM
(SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day',occurred_at) AS day,
          channel,
          COUNT(*) AS event_count
   FROM web_events
GROUP BY 1,2) sub
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

SELECT AVG(standard_qty) AS standard_qty_avg,
       AVG(gloss_qty) AS gloss_qty_avg,
       AVG(poster_qty) AS poster_qty_avg
FROM orders
WHERE DATE_TRUNC('month',occurred_at) =
(SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month',MIN(occurred_at)) FROM orders);

SELECT SUM(total_amt_usd)
FROM orders
WHERE DATE_TRUNC('month', occurred_at) =
      (SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', MIN(occurred_at)) FROM orders);

1- Provide the name of the sales_rep in each region with the largest amount of total_amt_usd sales.
SELECT s.name rep_name, r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_sales
FROM orders o
JOIN accounts a
ON o.account_id = a.id
JOIN sales_reps s
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
JOIN region r
ON s.region_id = r.id
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 3 DESC;

SELECT region_name, MAX(total_sales) total_amt
FROM (SELECT s.name rep_name, r.name region_name,
      SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_sales
      FROM orders o
      JOIN accounts a
      ON o.account_id = a.id
      JOIN sales_reps s
      ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
      JOIN region r
      ON s.region_id = r.id
      GROUP BY 1, 2) t1
GROUP BY 1;

SELECT t3.rep_name, t3.region_name, t3.total_amt
FROM(SELECT region_name, MAX(total_amt) total_amt
     FROM(SELECT s.name rep_name, r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt
             FROM sales_reps s
             JOIN accounts a
             ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
             JOIN orders o
             ON o.account_id = a.id
             JOIN region r
             ON r.id = s.region_id
             GROUP BY 1, 2) t1
     GROUP BY 1) t2
JOIN (SELECT s.name rep_name, r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt
     FROM sales_reps s
     JOIN accounts a
     ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
     JOIN orders o
     ON o.account_id = a.id
     JOIN region r
     ON r.id = s.region_id
     GROUP BY 1,2
     ORDER BY 3 DESC) t3
ON t3.region_name = t2.region_name AND t3.total_amt = t2.total_amt;

2- For the region with the largest sales total_amt_usd, how many total orders were placed?
SELECT r.name region_name, SUM(o.total) total_orders
FROM sales_reps s
JOIN accounts a
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
JOIN orders o
ON o.account_id = a.id
JOIN region r
ON r.id = s.region_id
GROUP BY region_name
HAVING SUM(o.total_amt_usd) = (SELECT MAX(total_amt)
FROM(SELECT r.name region_name, sum(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt
FROM sales_reps s
JOIN accounts a
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
JOIN orders o
ON o.account_id = a.id
JOIN region r
ON r.id = s.region_id
GROUP BY region_name) sub);

3- How many accounts had more total purchases than the account name which has bought the most standard_qty paper throughout their lifetime as a customer?
